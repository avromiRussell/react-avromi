This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Day 1 Exercises

Here you can find intro exercises to react, following the first day lecture

The exercises are in `src/exercises`, each one of them prefixed with the order number.

In each file, you have a comment explaining the task

## Installation

First you need to install the npm packages in this project.

Because we are using react, we will also use `yarn` which is an alternative to `npm` build by facebook
Yarn does not come with Node.js, so you'll have to install it manually.

You can install `yarn` by following the [installation guide (recommended)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Alternatively, you can install `yarn` using `npm`:

```bash
npm install yarn --global
```

After installing `yarn` enter this project directory (after cloning it)
And run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all the decencies specified in `package.json`

## Test Your Solution

We created built in tests for the exercises, to check if your code runs properly or not
The tests are under the `__tests__` directory. You can go there and inspect the code.

To execute the tests, you should run:

```bash
yarn test
```

To test only one exercise, you should run test-ex + _number_ of the exercise"

```bash
yarn test-ex1
```

This will keep a process open, that will run the tests every time you save a file (watch mode)

To kill the process, hit ctrl/cmd + c

### Enjoy coding with react!
